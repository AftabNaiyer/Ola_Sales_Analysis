The dataset includes 103,024 ride records with details like:

- **Booking Status**: Completed or Canceled.
- **Vehicle Type**: Mini, Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, eBike, etc.
- **Booking Value**: Fare charged per ride.
- **Payment Method**: Cash, UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card.
- **Ride Distance**: Total trip distance.
- **Driver & Customer Ratings**: Feedback scores.
- **Cancellation Reasons**: Provided by customers or drivers.

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Cancellation Rate**: Track ride cancellations and reasons.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Measure total revenue and average fare per ride.
- **Ride Distance Insights**: Study the effect of ride distance on revenue.
- **Payment Trends**: Identify customer payment preferences.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyze rating trends for service improvement.

## üìÇ Dataset Structure

- **Raw Data**: Ola_bookings.csv (Original data)
- **Processed Data**: Cleaned and analyzed in Power BI.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Domain_Knowledge.docx
- **Problem Statement**: Problem_Statement.docx
- **SQL Queries**: ola_sql_query.sql
- **Power BI Report**: ola_analysis.pbix

## üìå Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**
    - Fixed missing values and removed duplicates.
    - Formatted data for further analysis.

2. **Data Analysis (SQL)**
    - Ran SQL queries to extract useful insights.
    - Filtered data to analyze cancellations, revenue, and customer behavior.

3. **Visualization (Power BI)**
    - Created dashboards using Power BI.
    - Used DAX functions for calculating key metrics.

## üìä Dashboards Overview

### **1. Overall Dashboard**

- Examines driver and customer ratings.
- Identifies areas for service improvement.

## üìä DAX Functions Used

These DAX functions were used in Power BI to calculate metrics:

```dax
CanceledBookings = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Ola_bookings), Ola_bookings[Booking_Status] IN {"Canceled by Driver", "Canceled by Customer"})
CanceledPercentage = DIVIDE([CanceledBookings], [TotalBookings], 0)
TotalBookings = COUNTROWS(Ola_bookings)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

1. **Excel**: Data cleaning and management.
2. **SQL**: Data extraction and analysis.
3. **Power BI**: Dashboard visualization.

## üì• How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/ola-ride-analysis.git
    ```
2. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI.
3. Execute SQL queries from `ola_sql_query.sql` using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
